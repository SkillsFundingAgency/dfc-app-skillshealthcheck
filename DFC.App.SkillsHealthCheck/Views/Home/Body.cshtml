        <p class="govuk-body">The skills health check is a set of quizzes and activities designed to help you explore your skills, interests and motivations.</p>
        <p>Working through the skills health check can help you decide what kind of jobs might be right for you. </p>
        <p>You can save your results and come back to them at any time or able to download your report once you've completed at least one assessment.</p>
        <br/>
        <h2>We're removing the skills health check</h2>
        <p> On X September, we’re removing the skills health check as it no longer meets our accessibility standards.</p>
        <p>If you start a new skills health check and complete one of the assessments before 11 September, you can download your report if you want to keep a copy of it. </p>
        <p>From X September, you will not be able to access or download your report.</p>
